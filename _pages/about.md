Hello there! My name is Mithilesh Vaidya.

I am an AI Researcher at Descript.

I recently graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from GeorgiaTech.
Previously, I finished my dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay, India.

I plan to use this website as a medium for sharing my projects and other random thoughts.

I was part of Autonise AI, a small group of machine learning enthusiasts during my sophomore year.

In the summer of 2020, I interned at APT Portfolio, a high-frequency trading firm.

During my stay at IIT Bombay, I was a part of the [Digital Audio Processing lab](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/student/~daplab/) at IIT Bombay.
I worked with [Prof. Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/prao) on processing
children's speech using deep learning techniques. I mainly worked on modelling speech **prosody** for 
tasks such as **oral reading fluency assessment** and prosodic event detection (**prominence** and **phrase boundary**).

At GeorgiaTech, I worked with [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/home) on switching subspace models for neural spike data.

I also served on the Editorial Board of [Insight](https://www.insightiitb.org), IIT Bombay's student media body.

In my free time, I enjoy reading [books]({{site.url}}/books) and playing [tennis]({{site.url}}/tennis).
